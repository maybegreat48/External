# External
A POC for external native invoking using a just-in-time RAGE script bytecode compiler

Credits to [YimMenu](https://github.com/Yimura/YimMenu) for the GUI and features

Skids: The codebase is a mess and I highly recommend against using this "base". The GUI is performance intensive, doesn't receive keystrokes properly and is the reason for the premature end of this project
